This tutorial is result of my personal notes while trying (which I still do) to
learn Density Functional Theory calculations myself. I am no expert in this
subject. I am sharing this notes here, just in case it helps you getting
started. I will cite numerous other resources that I am following. Hope you will
find this tutorial helpful.

The quantum espresso input files, jupyter notebooks (containing python code for
visualizations), and other source files related to this tutorial can be found on
GitHub: [pranabdas/espresso](https://github.com/pranabdas/espresso/). You may clone
the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pranabdas/espresso.git
```

## Filename conventions
Lately, I decided to follow specific pattern for the filenames, but you can
choose whatever works best for you. Note that all example files in this
tutorial does not follow this convention yet.
```
{program}.{calculation}.{system}.{in, out}
{program}.{calculation}.{system_description}.{in, out}
{pw, pp, ...}.{scf, bands, ...}.{silicon, al_slab}.{in, out}
```

Example: *pw.bands.silicon.in* → *input* file for the *bands* calculation using
*PWscf* program for *silicon*.

For PWTK scripts, we will use `.pwtk` extension (e.g., *silicon_vc_relax.pwtk*).

## Unit conversions

- 1 Bohr = 0.529177249 Å
- 1 Rydberg (Ry) = 13.6056981 eV.

**Angstrom to Bohr converter:** lattice constants are often provided in
angstrom, you can use following utility to convert to Bohr.

import AngToBohr from '../src/apps/angToBohr';

<AngToBohr />
