Before we can run the Density of States (DOS) calculation, we need

1. Perform fixed-ion self consistent filed (scf) calculation.
2. Fix the parameters and run non-self consistent field (nscf) calculation with
denser k-point grid.

I have created a new input file (`si_scf_dos.in`) which is very much same as our
previous scf input file except some parameters are modified. You can find all
the input files in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pranabdas/espresso/).
We used the lattice constant value that we obtained from the relaxation
calculation. We should not directly use the experimental/real lattice constant
value. Depending on the method and pseudo-potential, it might result stress in
the system. We have increased the `ecutwfc` to have better precision. We run the
scf calculation:

```bash
pw.x < si_scf_dos.in > si_scf_dos.out
```

Next, we have prepared the input file for the `nscf` calculation. Where is have
added `occupations` in the `&system` card as `tetrahedra` (appropriate for DOS
calculation). We have increased the number of k-points to 12 × 12 × 12 with
automatic option. Also specify `nosym = .TRUE.` to avoid generation of
additional k-points in low symmetry cases. `outdir` and `prefix` must be same as
in the `scf` step, some of the inputs and output are read from previous step.

```bash
pw.x < si_nscf_dos.in > si_nscf_dos.out
```

Now our final step is to calculate the density of states. The DOS input file as
follows:

import si_dos_in from '!!raw-loader!/src/silicon/si_dos.in';

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="src/silicon/si_dos.in" showLineNumbers>{si_dos_in}</CodeBlock>

We run:
```bash
dos.x < si_dos.in > si_dos.out
```
The DOS data in the `si_dos.dat` file that we specified in our input file. We
can plot the DOS:

```python title="notebooks/silicon-dos.ipynb" showLineNumbers
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import rcParamsDefault
import numpy as np
%matplotlib inline

# load data
energy, dos, idos = np.loadtxt('../src/silicon/si_dos.dat', unpack=True)

# make plot
plt.figure(figsize = (12, 6))
plt.plot(energy, dos, linewidth=0.75, color='red')
plt.yticks([])
plt.xlabel('Energy (eV)')
plt.ylabel('DOS')
plt.axvline(x=6.642, linewidth=0.5, color='k', linestyle=(0, (8, 10)))
plt.xlim(-6, 16)
plt.ylim(0, )
plt.fill_between(energy, 0, dos, where=(energy < 6.642), facecolor='red', alpha=0.25)
plt.text(6, 1.7, 'Fermi energy', fontsize= med, rotation=90)
plt.show()
```

:::info Important

For a set of calculation, we must keep the `prefix` same. For example, the
**nscf** or **bands** calculation uses the wavefunction calculated by the
**scf** calculation. When performing different calculations, for example you
change a parameter and want to see the changes, you must use different output
folder or unique `prefix` for different calculations so that the outputs do not
get mixed.

:::tip

Sometimes it is important to sample the $\Gamma$ point for DOS calculation
(e.g., the conducting bands cross the Fermi surface only at $\Gamma$ point). In
such cases, we need to use odd k-grid (e.g., 9✕9✕5).
