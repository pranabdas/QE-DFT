In oder to consider spin orbit coupling effect in our electronic structure
calculation in quantum espresso, we need to use a full relativistic pseudo
potential. Following settings are needed in the `&SYSTEM` card:

```bash
&SYSTEM
    ...
    noncolin = .true.
    lspinorb = .true.
    ...
/
```

## Non collinear spin
In simple spin polarized calculation (`nspin=2`), the spin quantum number (up or
down) is considered in the calculation. In non-collinear case, the spin has more
degrees of freedom, and can be oriented in any direction. Non-collinear
magnetism is quite common in nature, where the spins are not parallel
(ferromagnetic) or anti-parallel (antiferromagnetic), rather they orient in
spirals, helicoids, canted or disordered. Non-collinear magnetism can occur
because of geometric frustration of magnetic interaction. It can also occur due
to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy which is the result of interaction between
the spin and lattice interaction. This relativistic effect comes via spin-orbit
coupling.

We can constrain the magnetic moment:
```bash
&SYSTEM
  ...
  constrained_magnetization = 'atomic direction'
  ...
/
```

Starting magnetization can be specified by `angle1` (angle with $z$ axis) and
`angle2` (angle of projection in $xy$-plane and with $x$-axis). Also check the
penalty function ($\lambda$).
```bash
&SYSTEM
  ...
  angle1(i) = 0.0d0
  angle2(i) = 0.0d0
  lambda = 0.5
  ...
/
```

`i` is the index of the atom in `ATOMIC_SPECIES` card.


## Strategy for convergence
Spin-orbit coupling calculations are often hard to converge. Use a smaller
`mixing_beta` for such calculations. First perform a collinear calculation with
non-relativistic pseudopotential, and then start from the obtained charge
density to perform non-colinear spin orbit calculation.

```bash
&ELECTRONS
  ...
  mixing_beta = 1.0000000000d-01
  startingpot = 'file'
/
```

When starting with non-collinear calculation from an existing charge density
file from a collinear lsda calculation, we need to set `lforcet=.true.`. It
assumes previous density points in z direction, and rotates in the direction
specified by `angle1` (initial magnetization angle with $z$-axis in degrees),
and `angle2` (angle in degrees for projections in $xy$-plane and with $x$-axis).
```bash
&SYSTEM
...
  angle1(i) = 0.0
  angle2(i) = 0.0
  lforcet = .true.
/
```

Also, make sure that energy and charge density cutoffs are sufficient. Certain
pseudo potentials might have issues, try with pseudo potentials from a different
library. In case of metallic systems, remember to apply smearing.

:::danger Common Errors

- **S matrix not positive definite:** This error might appear due to numerical
instability from overlapping atoms. Check atomic positions carefully. In one my
calculations, this error was resolved after setting higher `ecutrho`.

- Simplified LDA+U not implemented with `noncol` magnetism, use
`lda_plus_u_kind=1`.

## Bandstructure of Fe with SOC

import pw_scf_fe_soc_in from '!!raw-loader!/src/fe/pw.scf.fe_soc.in';

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="src/fe/pw.scf.fe_soc.in" showLineNumbers>{pw_scf_fe_soc_in}</CodeBlock>

Run the scf calculation:
```bash
mpirun -np 8 pw.x -i pw.scf.fe_soc.in > pw.scf.fe_soc.out
```

Prepare the input file for `nscf` `bands` calculation:

import pw_bands_fe_soc_in from '!!raw-loader!/src/fe/pw.bands.fe_soc.in';

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="src/fe/pw.bands.fe_soc.in" showLineNumbers>{pw_bands_fe_soc_in}</CodeBlock>

Run the `bands` calculation:
```bash
mpirun -np 8 pw.x -i pw.bands.fe_soc.in > pw.bands.fe_soc.out
```

Finally post process the bandstructure data:

import pp_bands_fe_soc_in from '!!raw-loader!/src/fe/pp.bands.fe_soc.in';

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="src/fe/pp.bands.fe_soc.in" showLineNumbers>{pp_bands_fe_soc_in}</CodeBlock>

In this case `spin_component` has been removed and we add `lsigma(3)=.true.`
that instructs the program to compute the expectation value for the `z`
component of the spin operator for each eigenfunction and save all values in
the file `fe.noncolin.data.3`. All values in this case are either +1/2 or -1/2.

```bash
mpirun -np 8 bands.x -i pp.bands.fe_soc.in > pp.bands.fe_soc.out
```

## SOC calculation for GaAs

Please check the respective [input files](
https://github.com/pranabdas/espresso/tree/master/src/GaAs).

```bash
mpirun -np 8 pw.x -i pw.scf.GaAs_soc.in > pw.scf.GaAs_soc.out
mpirun -np 8 pw.x -i pw.bands.GaAs_soc.in > pw.bands.GaAs_soc.out
mpirun -np 8 bands.x -i pp.bands.GaAs_soc.in > pp.bands.GaAs_soc.out
```
