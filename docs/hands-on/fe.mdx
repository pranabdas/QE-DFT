I am following this example from the [ICTP online school 2021](
https://gitlab.com/QEF/materials-for-max-qe2021-online-school).

We will perform the SCF KS orbital calculations on magnetic (`nspin=2`) iron.
Since the d-orbitals of Fe atom are localized/ hard, we will use ultra-soft
pseudo potential (USPP).

:::note

If we have crystal structure with only one atom per unit cell, or only one type
of atoms, the only possible ordering is ferromagnetic. In such cases, we need to
form supercell with more number of atoms or label multiple atoms separately, so
that their magnetic orientation could be different thus having the possibility
of ferro- or antiferromagnetic final states.

:::

Run the SCF calculations for both ferro- and antiferromagnetic structures.
Notice that for ferromagnetic, we have BCC structure with only one type of atom,
while we use simple cubic structure for antiferromagnetic case with two
different atomic labels. For antiferromagnetic calculation, we need to start
with opposite initial spins.

```bash
pw.x -i pw.scf.fe_fm.in > pw.scf.fe_fm.out
pw.x -i pw.scf.fe_afm.in > pw.scf.fe_afm.out
```

:::note

In case of the AFM calculation, if we have started with FM (say, for both atom
types `starting_magnetization=0.6` ), the calculation would still converge to
AFM state as it is the true ground state for this system, albeit it would take
more iteration to converge. If you get different results due to different
starting magnetization, you might need a stricter convergence criteria.

:::info

In case of ultrasoft pseudo potentials, the Quantum Espresso default of
`ecutrho` 4 times of `ecutoff` is not sufficient. We need to set `ecutrho` 8 or
even 12 times that of `ecutoff`. We must test the convergence for our set
values.

## Convergence test for USPP
Below is the PWTK script file:

import fe_ecut_pwtk from '!!raw-loader!/src/fe/fe_ecut.pwtk';

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="src/fe/fe_ecut.pwtk" showLineNumbers>{fe_ecut_pwtk}</CodeBlock>

Run the script:
```bash
pwtk fe_ecut.pwtk
```

## Density of states calculation

PWTK script to calculate DOS and p-DOS:

import fe_dos_pwtk from '!!raw-loader!/src/fe/fe_dos.pwtk';

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="src/fe/fe_dos.pwtk" showLineNumbers>{fe_dos_pwtk}</CodeBlock>

Below is the plots of total and projected density of states.

Also see bandstructure of Fe with and without [SOC](
soc#bandstructure-of-fe-with-soc).

## Paramagnetism
Paramagnetic materials have fluctuating magnetic moments that may not be
properly described DFT. One approach is to model paramagnetic materials in DFT
calculation by building a large supercell and assign randomly oriented magnetic
moments.

Also note that DFT assumes zero temperature, so it makes sense to perform FM or
AFM calculation for magnetic systems.

## Visualizing magnetic moments
We can use [XCrySDen](http://www.xcrysden.org) to visualize the orientation of
magnetic moments. XCrySDen cannot directly read the Quantum Espresso output
files for magnetic moment vectors, instead we need to create the input `.xsf`
file with magnetic moments as force vector. You can also change the background
color from black from the Palette Menu which is located in the left of File
menu.

import fe_mag from '!!raw-loader!/src/fe/fe.xsf';

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="src/fe/fe.xsf" showLineNumbers>{fe_mag}</CodeBlock>

Open the file from XCrySDen Menu: **File → Open Structure → Open XSF**. Then go
to **Display** menu and select **Forces**. If you want to adjust scaling for the
force vectors, go to **Modify → Force Settings** and set suitable Length factor.
